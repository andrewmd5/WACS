## Getting Started

### Installation

The easiest way to use WACS is to add the package from NuGet

```bash
dotnet add package WACS
dotnet add package WACS.WASIp1
````

If you prefer to build WACS from source, you can clone the repo and build it with the .NET SDK:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kelnishi/WACS.git
cd WACS
dotnet build
```

## Usage

Basic usage example, how to load and run a WebAssembly module:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Wacs.Core;
using Wacs.Core.Runtime;

//Create a runtime
var runtime = new WasmRuntime();

//Bind a host function
//  This can be any regular C# delegate.
//  The type here will be validated against module imports.
runtime.BindHostFunction<Action<char>>(("env", "sayc"), c =>
{
    System.Console.Write(c);
});

//Load a module from a binary file
using var fileStream = new FileStream("HelloWorld.wasm", FileMode.Open);
var module = BinaryModuleParser.ParseWasm(fileStream);

//Instantiate the module
var modInst = runtime.InstantiateModule(module);

//Register the module to add its exported functions to the export table
runtime.RegisterModule("hello", modInst);

//Get the module's exported function
if (runtime.TryGetExportedFunction(("hello", "main"), out var mainAddr))
{
    //For wasm functions you can expect return types as Wacs.Core.Runtime.Value
    //  Value has implicit conversion to many useful primitive types
    var mainInvoker = runtime.CreateInvokerFunc<Value>(mainAddr);
    
    //Call the wasm function and get the result
    //  Implicit conversion from Value to int
    int result = mainInvoker();
    
    System.Console.Error.WriteLine($"hello.main() => {result}");
}
```

## Integration with Unity

### With Unity Package Manager
1. Window>Package Manager
2. Click + Add package from git URL...
3. Enter the package repo URL:
 ```text
 git@github.com:kelnishi/WACS-Unity.git
 ```
4. Click Add

This will put the DLLs into your project. 
Import the WasmRunner sample to get started.

### Manually
To manually add WACS to a Unity project, you'll need to add the following DLLs to your Assets directory:
- Wacs.Core.dll
- FluentValidation.dll
- Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool.dll

Set **Player Settings>Other Settings>Api Compatibility Level** to **.NET Standard 2.1**.

## Integration with Godot
WACS is compatible with **[Godot Engine -.NET](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics.html)** in C# projects.
- Add WACS via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WACS) with the commandline or your IDE's NuGet tool.
- See [sample/GodotSample.cs](https://github.com/kelnishi/WACS/tree/main/sample/GodotSample.cs) for loading wasm files.

## Interop Bindings

WACS simplifies host function bindings, allowing you to easily call .NET functions from WebAssembly modules.
This allows seamless communication between your host environment and WebAssembly without boilerplate code.
Similarly, calling into wasm code is done by generating a typed delegate.

Example from WASIp1:

```csharp
//Alias your types for readability
using ptr = System.Int32;

//WACS can bit-convert types like Enums and explicit layout structs
[WasmType(nameof(ValType.I32))]
public enum ErrNo : ushort
{
    Success = 0,
    ...
}

//Supply the delegate definition when binding
//  ExecContext is an optional first parameter for Memory and Stack manipulation
runtime.BindHostFunction<Func<ExecContext,ptr,ptr,ErrNo>>(
   (module, "args_get"), ArgsGet);

// WASIp1's args_get
public ErrNo ArgsGet(ExecContext ctx, ptr argvPtr, ptr argvBufPtr)
{
    var mem = ctx.DefaultMemory;
            
    foreach (string arg in _config.Arguments)
    {
        // Copy argument string to argvBufPtr.
        int strLen = mem.WriteUtf8String((uint)argvBufPtr, arg, true);
                
        // Write pointer to argument in argvPtr.
        mem.WriteInt32(argvPtr, argvBufPtr);

        // Update offsets.
        argvBufPtr += strLen;
        argvPtr += sizeof(ptr);
    }

    return ErrNo.Success;
}
```

## Customization

If you'd like to customize the wasm runtime environment, I recommend downloading the full source for examples.

The `Wacs.WASIp1` implementation is a good starting point for how to set up your own library of bindings.
It also contains examples of more advanced usage like binding multiple return values and full operand stack access.

The `Spec.Test` project runs the wasm spec test suite. This also contains examples for binding other runtime environment
objects like Tables, Memories, and Variables.

Custom Instruction implementations can be patched in by replacing or inheriting from `SpecFactory`.

## Performance

WACS is a bytecode (wasm) interpreter running on a bytecode interpreted (or JIT'd) language (CIL/CLR). This is, as you can imagine,
*not a recipe for raw performance*. However, recognizing this dynamic allows us to make certain optimizations to achieve
performance closer to other languages in other VMs.

### The Spec-Defined Implementation
The Wasm Virtual Machine is a stack machine. This means that instructions produce operands, place them on the stack, and then other
instructions consume them by popping them from the stack. WACS uses a pre-allocated linear stack for more register-like performance.
However, even a virtualized stack is costly to manage as the CLR will still need to manage memory and objects at its boundaries.
To optimize further, we'll need to opportunistically use register-machine semantics by swapping out equivalent operations. 

### Link-time optimization
The design of the WASM VM includes block labelling for branch instructions and a heterogeneous operand/control stack.
WACS uses a split stack that separates operands and control. This enables us to make some key optimizations:
- Non-flushing branch jumps. We can leave operands on the stack if intermediate states don't interfere.
- Precomputed block labels. We can ditch the control frame's label stack entirely!
- Modern C# ObjectPools and ArrayPools minimize unavoidable allocation

### In-Memory Transpiling
Here's where we break WASM semantics and go off-road to claw back some performance.
A linear list of WASM instructions can be inverted into an expression tree. The WAT text format supports both the linear
and the tree structure; they are conceptually equivalent. We'll use this similarity by applying the transform to the binary AST.
Take for example, this sequence:
> i32.const 5   <- Pushes 5 onto the stack
> 
> i32.const 7   <- Pushes 7 onto the stack
> 
> i32.add       <- Pops 7, Pops 5, Pushes 12 onto the stack

For a sequence representing `5+7`, this is performing potentially 8+ function calls, multiple Value.ctors, memory bounds checks, etc.
All this, not even including the actual computation (+). Knowing this, we have an alternative. 

**Expression Tree Compilation**

```
       i32.add
     /         \
i32.const 5  i32.const 7
```
If enabled, WACS will do a linear pass through the instruction sequences and roll up interdependent instructions into directed acyclic graphs.
Instructions are replaced with functionally equivalent expression trees `InstAggregate`. The new aggregate instructions are *in-memory*
and are implemented with pre-built relational functions. Ultimately, these instructions are compiled by the dotnet build process into bytecode
to be run by the runtime. Thus, at runtime aggregate wasm instruction sequences map to pre-compiled implementations (*semi-transpiled*).

How does this differ from executing the wasm instructions linearly with the WACS VM? 
- No OpStack manipulation
- Values are passed directly without casting or boxing
- The CLR's implementation can use hardware more effectively (use registers instead of heap memory)
- Avoids instruction fetching and dispatch

In my testing, this leads to roughly 60% higher instruction processing throughput (128Mips -> 210Mips). These gains are situational however.
Linking of the instructions into a tree cannot 100% be determined across block boundaries. So in these cases, the transpiler just passes
the sequence through unaltered. So WASM code with lots of function calls or branches will see less benefit.

Optimization is an ongoing process and I have a few other strategies yet to implement.

### Expected Runtime Performance
When built in AOT or Release mode, my benchmarks show WACS runs between 2~10% native throughput for benchmark programs
like coremark. This is roughly on par with interpreted-only Python or about ~25% of an equivalent program written in C# on dotnet.

## Roadmap

The current TODO list includes:

- **Source Generated Bindings**: Use Roslyn source generator for generating bindings.
- **WASI p1 Test Suite**: Validate WASIp1 with the test suite for improved standard compliance.
- **WASI p2 and Component Model**: Implement the component model proposal.
- **Text Format Parsing**: Add support for WebAssembly text format.
- **SIMD Intrinsics**: Add hardware-accelerated SIMD (software implementation included in Wacs.Core).
- **Unity Bindings for SDL**: Implement SDL2 with Unity bindings.
- **JavaScript Proxy Bindings**: Maybe support common JS env functions.
